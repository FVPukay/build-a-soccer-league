# build-a-soccer-league

##### What this application does

This application reads the data from the supplied CSV file and splits 18
children into 3 evenly matched teams (Dragons, Sharks and Raptors) so that
each team has the same number of experienced players.  The program outputs a
text file called teams.txt that contains the league roster.  The script also creates 18 text files which are welcome letters to the players' guardians.

##### Screenshots of the text files that are created
